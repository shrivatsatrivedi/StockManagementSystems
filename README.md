Stock Management System - README
Overview
The Stock Management System is a Java-based console application that helps manage a stock of items in a store or inventory. The system allows users to add, remove, update, search for items, display stock information, and print transaction history and billing details. The system alerts the user when certain items have low stock levels.

Update Item Quantity: Enables updating the quantity of an item already in stock.
Search Item: Searches for items based on a keyword and displays matching results.
Display Stock: Displays the current items in stock, including their name, price, and quantity. The system also alerts the user if any items have low stock (less than 5 units).
Print Transaction History: Displays a history of all transactions (additions, removals, and updates).
Print Bill: Calculates and prints the total value of items in stock and shows the quantities and prices for each item.
